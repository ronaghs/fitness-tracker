### Description

Many individuals, at some point in their weightlifting journey, reach a juncture where they aspire to elevate their strength performance. A fundamental principle guiding this aspiration is progressive overload â€” a concept emphasizing the pursuit of incremental increases in weight, repetitions, or sets to actively increase strength and muscle development. Unsurprisingly, tracking workouts evolves from a choice, to a necessity, when it is time to take things to the next level.

ElevateExcellence allows users to organize, plan, and track workouts, featuring elements designed with progressive overloading in mind to streamline logging sessions. Interactive graphs illustrate personal records and weight volume per session, providing a visual representation of progression. The exercise library contains a plethora of exercise options, complete with animated gifs demonstrating proper form and linked YouTube videos for further explanations.
